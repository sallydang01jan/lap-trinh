	<h1>love you and back</h1>
	<p>Your eyes, like stars that light the night,
Your laughter, like a summer breeze,
Your smile, like sunshine, warm and bright,
You're all that I could ever seize.

Your heart, a treasure, pure and true,
Your soul, a melody, so sweet,
Your love, a gift, forever new,
A love like ours, can't be beat.

With you beside me, I am whole,
My life is filled with joy and grace,
You're more than just my heart and soul,
You're everything I long to embrace.
