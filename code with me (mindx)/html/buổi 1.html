    <p>I don’t know much about Gray, he’s got a unique look going and for some reason his name comes up before comedy legend and the king of late night Conan O’Brien when you google ‘Conan’ so I already had a little beef with him, but you know it’s fine. Now I know him as the dude who butched the National Anthem during the Home Run Derby.</p>
